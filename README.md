# PDF Numbering Using Python

This project focus on using Python for software development to help people, especially my University Choir by giving a watermark on the sheet music.
Advantages:
1. Auto Numbering and formatting to PDF
2. Using basic python codes

Disadvantages:
1. Still require image for processing (cannot use pdf as resource)
2. Not an application
